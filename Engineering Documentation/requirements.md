# Dev Toolkit Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

The Dev Toolkit is a Windows desktop application designed to enhance developer productivity by providing log parsing capabilities, workspace management, file monitoring, and customizable configuration. This tool aims to streamline common development workflows through a unified interface.

## 2. Core Requirements

### 2.1. Log File Parser

- **2.1.1.** Support parsing and visualization of common log formats (JSON, plain text, XML)
- **2.1.2.** Provide filtering capabilities based on timestamps, log levels, and custom regex patterns
- **2.1.3.** Allow real-time log tailing with configurable refresh rates
- **2.1.4.** Support for syntax highlighting and collapsible log entries
- **2.1.5.** Enable search functionality across log files with results highlighting
- **2.1.6.** Support for large log files (>1GB) with efficient memory usage
- **2.1.7.** Allow bookmarking of important log entries for later reference

### 2.2. Workspace Management

- **2.2.1.** Configure shortcuts to open specific folders, projects, or files
- **2.2.2.** Support launching applications with configurable parameters
- **2.2.3.** Integration with common code editors (VS Code, IntelliJ, Sublime, etc.)
- **2.2.4.** Provide quick access to recent workspaces
- **2.2.5.** Allow grouping of workspaces by project or type
- **2.2.6.** Support for environment-specific workspace configurations

### 2.3. File Monitoring

- **2.3.1.** Watch specified files and directories for changes
- **2.3.2.** Configure notifications for file system events (create, modify, delete)
- **2.3.3.** Support for pattern-based file watching (glob patterns)
- **2.3.4.** Provide a visual history of file changes
- **2.3.5.** Allow custom actions to be triggered on file events (script execution, application launch)
- **2.3.6.** Efficient polling or native file system event watching based on platform

### 2.4. Configuration System

- **2.4.1.** Support for .HOST configuration files
- **2.4.2.** Allow configuration of all tool features via the configuration file
- **2.4.3.** Support for environment variables in configuration
- **2.4.4.** Provide validation of configuration files
- **2.4.5.** Allow multiple configuration profiles
- **2.4.6.** Support for sharing configurations across teams

## 3. User Interface Requirements

- **3.1.** Clean, intuitive interface with light and dark themes
- **3.2.** Responsive design that works well on various screen sizes
- **3.3.** Dockable and resizable panels for different tool components
- **3.4.** Keyboard shortcuts for all common operations
- **3.5.** System tray integration for quick access and background operation
- **3.6.** Command palette for quick access to application features

## 4. Performance Requirements

- **4.1.** Fast startup time (<2 seconds on standard hardware)
- **4.2.** Minimal CPU and memory usage while idle
- **4.3.** Responsive UI during intensive operations (file parsing, monitoring)
- **4.4.** Efficient handling of large files and directories
- **4.5.** Background processing of CPU-intensive tasks

## 5. Technology Stack

- **5.1.** Built using Windows Forms Blazor for modern UI development
- **5.2.** .NET 8.0 or later as the base framework
- **5.3.** Windows-specific optimizations and native integration
- **5.4.** Blazor WebAssembly for rich interactive components
- **5.5.** Windows Forms for native desktop integration

## 6. Integration Capabilities

- **6.1.** CLI interface for automation and scripting
- **6.2.** Plugin system for extending functionality
- **6.3.** API for integration with other development tools
- **6.4.** Integration with version control systems (Git, SVN)
- **6.5.** Support for webhooks to notify external systems of events

## 7. Security Requirements

- **7.1.** Secure storage of sensitive configuration data
- **7.2.** Option to encrypt log data for sensitive environments
- **7.3.** Sandboxed execution of custom scripts and actions
- **7.4.** Proper handling of file permissions

## 8. .HOST Configuration Format Specification

The `.HOST` file should use a structured format (YAML or JSON) with the following major sections:

```yaml
# Example .HOST file structure
version: "1.0"

workspaces:
  project1:
    path: "/path/to/project1"
    editor: "vscode"
    shortcuts:
      open: "Ctrl+Shift+1"
      terminal: "Ctrl+Alt+1"
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: "development"

file_monitoring:
  watched_paths:
    - path: "/path/to/logs/*.log"
      events: ["modify", "create"]
      actions:
        - type: "notify"
          title: "Log Updated"
        - type: "execute"
          command: "./scripts/process_logs.sh"

log_parsing:
  profiles:
    nodejs:
      path_pattern: "*.log"
      format: "json"
      timestamp_field: "time"
      level_field: "level"
      message_field: "msg"
      highlighting:
        error: "red"
        warning: "yellow"
        info: "blue"

ui:
  theme: "dark"
  layout: "default"
  panels:
    - id: "logs"
      position: "bottom"
      size: 0.3
```
